# AbyssalMonkey
The origional developer of this is Kwevin from the isxGames discord. The origional name of this was abyss.iss
As I did not develope the origional basecode for this, and was given it to do whatever i choose. I have chosen to evolve this code into Abyssal Monkey
Abyssal Monkey is an abyssal bot for eveonline. I did not develope the origional base code for this but I am working on updating it to include more dynamic features such as the following.

#0 Fix Filiment use
#1 Simple Gui
#2 Support for random weapon configurations
#3 Support for Multi tank types
#4 Support for cap injectors
