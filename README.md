# AbyssalMonkey
The origional code this is based on is Kwevin from the isxGames discord. The origional name of this was abyss.iss
I have updated a lot ot bits and pieces in the code to many changes to count.
The goal is to rebuild this with a simple gui to start and end the bot

this currently only works with passive fit
the fit.txt file shows the fit i recomend using including implants.

Currently the bot only functions in the TEST version of ISXEVE
Install it in the lavishsoft consol with the following 
in the consol type ISXEVE:InstallTest

Install Instructions
Download current version
make a folder in your \InnerSpace\Scripts\
called AbyssalMonkey

restart both

Update your AbyssalMonkey.iss config section at the top of the script
make sure missle and drone range matches, have the appropriate amount drones, ammo, & filaments

Make sure you have a bookmark for both your home station & your abyssal safe
